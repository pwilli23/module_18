# Module 18 Project

## About the Project:

In this project we created a blockchain based ledger system to conduct financial transactions on a Streamlit application. 

## Dependencies Needed to run the Application:
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - *an open source library that turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.*
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - *a Python library that reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables.*

The image you see below is a screenshot of our Streamlit program

How to use the Application: 
* The user creating the transaction can input data about who the sender and receiver of the transaction are and the amount they intend to send
* Once the user clicks the 'Add Block' button the transaction is added to the Blockchain
